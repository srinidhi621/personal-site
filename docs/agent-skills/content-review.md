# Content review skill

Use this when Srinidhi shares a draft and wants feedback + edits.

## What “good” looks like (for this site)

- **Clear thesis**: a reader can paraphrase the point after the first section.
- **Concrete evidence**: examples, constraints, numbers, or code when relevant.
- **Tight structure**: each section earns its place; no detours.
- **Readable pacing**: short paragraphs; headings that guide scanning.
- **Honest limits**: what you didn’t test / what might be wrong.

## Review passes (use in order)

### Pass 1: Structure & intent (highest leverage)

- Does the intro set the stakes and the promise?
- Are the section headings a coherent argument?
- Is there one obvious “through-line”, or multiple posts mixed together?

Deliverable: a short “structure diagnosis” + 2–5 recommended structural edits.

### Pass 2: Clarity & flow

- Topic sentence first in each section.
- Define terms once; avoid synonym-swapping for the same concept.
- Replace vague nouns (“things”, “stuff”, “this”) with specifics.

Deliverable: concrete line edits for the first 20–30% (pattern demonstration), then a list of recurring fixes.

### Pass 3: Technical rigor (when applicable)

- Are claims falsifiable? Are assumptions stated?
- Are benchmarks comparable? Are axes labeled? Is methodology reproducible?
- Are tradeoffs explicit (cost, latency, failure modes, maintenance)?

Deliverable: “rigor notes” + missing details checklist.

### Pass 4: Voice & tone

Target voice: confident, precise, curious; avoid hype.

- Prefer “what I observed / measured / shipped” over generic advice.
- Cut inflated framing unless the substance supports it.

Deliverable: 3–10 suggested rewrites of representative paragraphs.

## Output format (how to give feedback)

1) **Executive summary** (3–6 bullets): what works + what to change.
2) **Top 3 edits**: highest impact changes to make first.
3) **Suggested edits**: inline changes for key sections (or a patch/diff if requested).
4) **Publish readiness**: ready / close / not ready, with why.

## SEO/social sanity check (lightweight)

- `title` is specific and searchable.
- `summary` and/or `description` matches the actual content.
- Tags are consistent with existing taxonomy.
