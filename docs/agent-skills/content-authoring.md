# Content authoring skill

Use this when Srinidhi wants help turning an idea into a publishable post.

## 1) Clarify the target

Ask (briefly):

- **Audience**: who is this for (and what do they already know)?
- **Outcome**: what should a reader be able to do/think differently after reading?
- **Scope**: what is *in* and explicitly *out* for this piece?
- **Length**: rough target (short note vs full essay).

## 2) Choose the content type

Pick the right section based on intent:

- **Writing** (`content/writing/`): essays, technical deep-dives, engineering practice.
- **Fiction** (`content/fiction/`): narrative experiments.
- **Links** (`content/links/`): annotated link + takeaway.

If unclear, default to **Writing**.

## 3) Produce a strong outline (fast)

Use one of these outline templates:

### Explanatory essay

- Hook: problem + stakes
- Background: what you assume, what you define
- Core idea: the thesis in 1–2 sentences
- 2–4 sections: each with one “claim → evidence → implication”
- Counterpoint / limitations
- Practical takeaways

### Experiment log / benchmark write-up

- What you tested and why
- Setup (constraints, data, methodology)
- Results (with charts/tables)
- What surprised you
- What changed your mind
- Next experiments

### Opinion / leadership post

- Moment/observation
- Thesis
- Examples (real constraints)
- Framework / heuristics
- Failure modes
- Closing: what you do differently now

## 4) Draft in passes (don’t perfect line-by-line)

- **Pass A (skeleton)**: headings + bullets; no prose polishing.
- **Pass B (prose)**: convert bullets to paragraphs; add transitions.
- **Pass C (tighten)**: delete repetition; sharpen topic sentences; reduce jargon.

## 5) Front matter defaults (practical)

Ensure the draft has:

- `title` that is specific (avoid vague metaphors)
- `summary` (1–2 lines) that matches what the reader gets
- `description` (optional but ideal) for social/SEO
- `tags` that match existing taxonomy where possible
- `draft = true` until ready

## 6) Promote internal navigation

Add 1–3 relevant internal links:

- To a previous Writing post
- To the About page (if relevant)
- To a follow-up post or “related reading”

## 7) “Ready to publish” handoff

When Srinidhi says “ship it”, switch to:

- `publishing-checklist.md` (mechanical correctness)
- `content-review.md` (final editorial pass)
