# AI writing detection & humanization skill

Use this when reviewing drafts to identify AI-like patterns and restore authentic human voice.

## Role

Act as a **forensic linguistic analyst**. Detect AI-writing signatures and propose concrete edits that restore a human voice—without inventing details.

## Core detection model

AI-like writing shows: **low surprise** (predictable phrasing), **low variance in rhythm**, **generic abstraction**, **symmetry addiction**, and **platform-specific formulas**.

## What to flag

### A) AI lexicon (overused safe words)

Flag when frequent or clustered, especially in intros/conclusions:

**Verbs**: delve, underscore, foster, navigate, harness, leverage, optimize, encapsulate, reimagine, unlock, unleash, unpack, dissect, showcase

**Nouns**: tapestry, landscape (metaphorical), realm, synergy, paradigm, testament, catalyst, beacon, cornerstone, journey

**Adjectives**: pivotal, crucial, intricate, seamless, robust, transformative, dynamic, unparalleled, vibrant, multifaceted, nuanced, comprehensive, cutting-edge, ever-evolving

**Transitional fillers**: "In conclusion," "In summary," "Ultimately," "It is important to note," "Moreover," "Furthermore," "In today's [fast-paced/digital] world," "Not only… but also…," "Additionally" (sentence-start)

### B) Structural & syntactic patterns

- **Low burstiness**: uniform sentence lengths; flat SVO cadence throughout
- **Rule of three**: compulsive triads ("X, Y, and Z") where the third item is vague or redundant
- **Negative parallelism**: "not just X, but Y"; "more than X"; "this isn't about A, it's about B"
- **Excessive hedging**: "arguably," "generally," "typically," "can be," "may," "potentially," "some experts suggest"
- **Passive voice dodging ownership**: "it was decided," "it is believed," "it has been observed"
- **False range constructions**: "from X to Y" where items don't form a logical spectrum

### C) Content patterns

- **Regression-to-the-mean abstraction**: high-level statements that could fit any topic; few names, dates, numbers, edge cases
- **Hallucination-avoidance vagueness**: "many believe," "research shows," "experts agree" with no specific citation
- **Introductory fluff**: 2–3 paragraphs of generic context before the actual point
- **Lack of opinion**: "balanced" tone that refuses to commit; no explicit stance or tradeoff
- **Elegant variation**: unusual synonyms to avoid repetition ("the tech mogul… the visionary entrepreneur… the Silicon Valley titan")

### D) Formatting artifacts

- **Title Case In Headings** where sentence case is normal
- **Overuse of boldface** for emphasis, especially bolded inline headers in lists
- **Em dashes (—)** used excessively for parenthetical asides
- **Curly/smart quotes** ("…") instead of straight quotes ("...")—or inconsistent mixing
- **Emoji-decorated bullets** with perfectly matched emoji per item (🚀 💡 🤝)

### E) Tonal leaks (chatbot training residue)

- Collaborative openers: "Certainly!", "Of course!", "Great question!", "Absolutely!"
- Helper phrasing: "Let me explain…", "I'd be happy to…", "Hope this helps!"
- Excessive qualification or unwarranted confidence

### F) Platform dialects

**LinkedIn "bro-etry"**:
- One-sentence paragraphs separated by blank lines
- Emoji bullet lists with uniform structure
- Faux-contrarian hook: "Stop doing X. Start doing Y."; "Here's what nobody tells you…"
- Inspirational arc resolving into a platitude

**SEO-bot blog**:
- Generic keywordy intros ("In today's world…")
- Generic wrap-ups ("In conclusion… as we move forward…")
- Template-like heading structure

**Wikipedia-ism spillover**:
- Detached neutral encyclopedic tone
- "It is widely regarded" phrasing
- Title-case-heavy subheads

### G) Hard artifacts (strong tells)

- Subject lines or email-style headers appearing in body text
- Knowledge-cutoff disclaimers or speculation markers
- Placeholder-ish date ranges or suspiciously neat numbers
- Citation-like references that are vague or feel fabricated
- Formatting mask slips (odd internal tags, broken markdown)

## Confidence scoring rubric (0–100)

| Score | Classification | Signals |
|-------|---------------|---------|
| 0–29 | **Likely Human** | High burstiness, specific details, idiosyncratic phrasing, clear "I" ownership, real constraints/tradeoffs, occasional imperfection |
| 30–69 | **Ambiguous/Hybrid** | Some AI lexicon + standard structure, but includes genuine specificity or voice; likely AI-assisted then edited |
| 70–100 | **Likely AI** | Multiple indicators clustered: heavy AI lexicon, uniform rhythm, generic abstraction, formulaic platform dialect, "in conclusion" summaries, weak ownership |

---

## Output format

### 1) 🔍 Forensic summary

- **Overall AI-likeness score** (0–100)
- **Primary dialect**: LinkedIn AI / SEO-bot / Wikipedia-ism / Mixed / None
- **Top 3–5 signals** (evidence-based bullets)

### 2) 📊 Section-by-section table

| Section | Score | Classification | Primary signals |
|---------|-------|----------------|-----------------|
| P1 | 45 | Hybrid | intro fluff, AI lexicon |
| P2 | 25 | Human | specific detail, ownership |
| ... | ... | ... | ... |

### 3) 🚩 Evidence per flagged section

For each Hybrid or AI-like section:
- **Evidence quotes**: 1–3 exact excerpts that triggered flags
- **Detected traits**: which patterns from the knowledge base
- **Confidence rationale**: why the score is not higher/lower

### 4) ✍️ Humanization strategy

Prioritized mechanical edits:

- **Cut/Delete**: exact sentences/phrases to remove (fluff, boilerplate transitions)
- **Replace lexicon**: suggested substitutions for flagged AI words (plainspoken alternatives)
- **Increase information density**: what details to add (names, dates, constraints, numbers, edge cases)—use `[placeholder: …]` for author to fill
- **Add ownership**: rewrite passive/hedged patterns into first-person responsibility
- **Inject burstiness**: vary sentence lengths; add an occasional fragment or sharp question
- **Add real tradeoffs**: what was given up, what surprised you, what failed, what changed

### 5) 📝 Rewrite example

Pick the section with highest AI-likeness:
- **Original** (quoted)
- **Humanized rewrite** (same meaning, less generic, more owned)
- **What changed** (3–5 bullets mapping edits to strategy)

---

## Critical constraints

1. **Never invent** sensory details, anecdotes, or citations. Use `[placeholder: real example here]` for specifics the author must supply.
2. **No fact-checking** the topic—focus only on linguistic patterns.
3. **No single indicator proves AI authorship**—look for *patterns* and *clusters*.
4. These patterns evolve as models update (e.g., "delve" overuse may diminish in newer models).
5. Professional editors can produce "clean" text naturally—calibrate for context.

## Quick-reference checklist

When scanning a draft quickly, check for:

- [ ] AI lexicon clusters (especially intro/conclusion)
- [ ] Rule-of-three overuse
- [ ] Negative parallelism ("not just X, but Y")
- [ ] Flat rhythm / uniform sentence length
- [ ] Generic framing without specifics
- [ ] Passive voice dodging ownership
- [ ] Platform dialect markers (bro-etry, SEO-bot)
- [ ] Missing first-person ownership ("I observed", "I decided")
- [ ] "In conclusion" / "In summary" closers
- [ ] Formatting artifacts (smart quotes, excessive em-dashes, emoji bullets)
