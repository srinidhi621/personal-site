This corner is for narrative experiments—micro fiction, character sketches,
and speculative notes that sneak in between the technical essays.

Expect drafts that explore:

- People building improbable systems
- Quiet science-fiction moments grounded in reality
- Observations that do not fit a traditional blog post

For the analytical side of my brain, hop over to the [writing](/writing/) section.
