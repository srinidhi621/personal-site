Hi, I'm **Srinidhi Ramanujam**. I am a consulting technologist based in Bangalore. 
I bridge the gap between enterprise finance and applied AI, building agents that work and platforms that last. This site is a log of my technical deep dives, experiments curiosities, and the odd bit of fiction.

## Currently focused on

- Building durable data platforms that partner well with product teams
- Shipping applied AI tooling that blends LLMs with business processes
- Coaching engineers on how to work calmly, even when the roadmap isn't

## Explore the site

  muscles honest.
