Hi, I'm **Srinidhi Ramanujam**, a consulting technologist based in Bangalore. 
I bridge the gap between enterprise finance and applied AI, building agents that work and platforms that last. 

This site is a log of my technical deep dives, experiments curiosities, and the odd bit of fiction.

## Currently focused on

- Building and measuring LLM workflows that ship
- Exploring retrieval and agent patterns with real constraints (cost, latency, failure modes)
- Logging the experiments, lessons, and reversals - and the odd bit of fiction

## Explore the site

  muscles honest.
