I keep this running log of articles, talks, repos, and gadgets that sparked
an idea. Each entry includes a quick note explaining why it matters to data
engineering, AI practice, or creative work.

Use it as a lightweight reading list or as breadcrumbs into topics I plan to
cover in longer [writing](/writing/) pieces.
