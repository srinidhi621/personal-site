Hi, I'm **Srinidhi Ramanujam**—an engineering leader focused on building data
platforms and applied AI teams that actually ship. This site documents the
patterns, experiments, and stories that shape my work.

Highlights:

- Lead data and AI platform engineering for high-growth product teams
- Collaborate closely with product and research partners on pragmatic ML
- Write to distill lessons and to keep my fiction muscles active

When I'm not writing, you'll find me mentoring teams, tinkering with new AI
tools, or building simple automations that save future-me time.
